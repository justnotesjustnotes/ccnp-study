explanation:
mac address 
32 bit address in the nic. 
ethernet frame header
contains a few field most important field are the source and destination mac address

mac address learning 
the mac addresses are saved in the mac address table, 
dymanic the switch looks at the source mac adress to remember what mac address is asociated to what port. 
static configured in the mac address table. or byt cpu
the addresses are remembered for 300 seconds by default this can be configured. 
when the port is turned off then the mac address is also forgotten. 

commands
#showing the mac address table 
show mac address-table
#search the mac address table for a specific address 
show mac address-table address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
show the amount of addresses inside the mac address table
show mac accdress-table count

#change the aging timer (recomended to not change this value)
switch(config)# mac address-table aging-time <secs> 
#configure static mac address
switch(config)# mac address-table static <mac> vlan <id> interface <type/number> 
#example
mac address-table static aa:bb:cc:ee:dd:ff vlan 20 interface ge0/0/2

explanation: 
what does a switch do with a ethernet frame 
possible action:
forward  (mac address is known - forward to correct mac address) 
flood   (when the mac address is unkwown an arp packet will be sent flooding from all ports) 
discord (this happens when 2 mac address are learned from the same port - switch asumes that they can communicate withoud it)
        (also happens when the frame is to big or small this is called giant or a runt)
